WHAT'S THIS?
============

This document contains a list of various common deficiencies in the
So*-libraries that are larger in scope than just simple API additions
/ changes (see the api-wish-list.txt file for that kind of "mini"
projects).



COMMON STUFF TO FIX IN THE SO* LIBRARIES
========================================


* Cross-platform spaceball and joystick device support

  Requested by Coin PEL holder Daniel Soto Alvarez.

  We already have support for spaceballs and joysticks implemented for
  some of the So*-libraries.

  For spaceball SDKs, see
