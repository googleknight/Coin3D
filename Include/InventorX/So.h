// We choose to not include classes that are "mostly internal":
// bundles, caches, elements, and projectors.
//
// Base classes are not included. They should for the most part be
// included by the other classes using them.
//
// Classes for interaction is not included either, as they can be seen
// as a later add-on to the core library, and it's not unlikely that
// we'll eventually make their inclusion a configure/build
// option. That goes for nodekits, draggers, and manips.
//
// The library can be built without VRML97 nodes, and without the
// thread abstraction classes, so they are also not part of this
// header file.
